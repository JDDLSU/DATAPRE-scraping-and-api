       "  'title': 'Glenn Cagandahan: Master of everyday Pinoy steampunk art',\n",
       "  'full_article': '\\n\\nGlenn Cagandahan in his studio —EDGAR ALLAN M. SEMBRANO\\nArt critic Cid Reyes once described Glenn Cagandahan’s works as done with “fantastical visions,” with diverse themes from Philippine personages and legends to contemporary culture, which are often executed into steampunk assemblages, in that style that combines history and technology inspired by science fiction.\\n“From out of an assembly line of mechanical parts, dazzling in their fractal repetition at once an abstraction and representation of Man as Machine, or The Machine as Monster that gnaws at man’s soul, Glenn Cagandahan proffers his newfound vision of art—species in itself of theatrical choreography in the way the molded figures, with their smooth, mask-like faces, attach space with their dramatic stances,” said Reyes.\\n“Bull of Courage”\\nCagandahan, a Paete, Laguna, native, is a product of the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Fine Arts who first tried his hand at sculptural works through the restoration of public sculptures inside UP, which were assigned to him and his fellow students then by their professor Ginny Dandan.\\nThis exposure, he said, led him to discover a method of restoring damaged wooden sculptures by combining Epoxy clay and sawdust, the same materials he used when he ventured into the world of visual art close to 20 years ago.\\nEveryday life\\n“Future Perfect” book cover\\nSince then, Cagandahan’s works expanded from wooden sculptures to mixed media and assemblages. He likes to execute works related to the Filipinos’ everyday life, family scenes and relationships.\\nHis oeuvre also includes those with religious themes mainly because of his Christian faith, being a son of a Christian pastor and a pastor himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHis art is definitely Filipino, and most people can identify and relate to his award-winning works.\\n“It’s Filipino simply because my art is rooted in my experience and interaction with my surroundings, people, cultures and beliefs,” he said, adding he is always inspired in his craft by God, country and family.\\n“My art is my life and everything about my art is about me and everything that has happened in the past and current situation,” he said.\\n“Namimingwit”\\nLike breathing\\n“I am a probinsiyano (from the province), so this reflects in my works, plus I am also a musician and a pastor. That’s why my sculptures depict music and spirituality,” he explained.\\nHe lists master carver Luis Ac-ac and the famed Michael Cacnio as his local influences, while the French Auguste Rodin, considered as the father of modern sculpture, and the great Michelangelo are the international artists who influenced him and his works.\\n“Sukob” —PHOTOS COURTESY OF FSI\\nFor Cagandahan, it is important to “live your life in pursuing your passion, since it is the only way you will live. Art is like breathing because if you don’t breathe, you die,” he said, saying it is the “same thing with art, since if you don’t do art as an artist, that’s the end of it!”\\nFor his works, he said he does not want to be boxed in, as he does not stop exploring other themes and skills for his chosen field of endeavor. “I want to continuously evolve in subjects and techniques as I traverse in my career,” he said.\\nThat career of close to two decades has earned a number of awards for Cagandahan. He placed second for his work “Paul and Silas” during the 2006 edition of the Art Association of the Philippines Annual Art Competition, the same event where his other work “Pagdagit” was cited with an honorable mention in 2004. He was also given honorable mention awards in the same contest in 2005 and 2007 for his works “Gomburza” and “Poseidon,” respectively.\\n‘Future Perfect’\\n“Fishball Vendor”\\nThe Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) published a book on him titled “Future Perfect.”\\nThe book, authored by Reyes, journalist and educator Evelyn Katigbak, FSI head ambassador Jose Maria Cariño, and foreign affairs research specialist Luzviminda Naval, is “a celebration of the genius and resolve of young Filipino artists, perfectly represented by mixed media sculptor Glenn Cagandahan.”\\nIt is part of FSI’s pivot to Philippine arts, culture and heritage promotion which started last year as part of the DFA’s push for public and cultural diplomacy.\\nIn the book, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said, “Showcasing artistic talent and heritage should be a main part of diplomacy” as “sometimes, it is easier to foster understanding in the vivid silence of a painting or a compressed action of a sculpture than with words and phrases, and in touching the deep places all humans have in common, art compresses experience; discloses divides; renders differences trivial.” —CONTRIBUTED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': '\\n\\nMiss Philippines Earth 2019 Janelle Tee is getting out of the box as she plays a sexy role in her latest movie, something she feels that she has to go through, just like any other aspiring actress.\\nTee plays Euka in “Putahe” who sheds her mysterious aura and reveals her wild, seductive side as she engages in a tryst with Ayanna Misola’s Jenny character.\\nHer transition from a former beauty queen to a sexy star is not without challenges.\\n“I would say [it is] challenging [because] from being wholesome and then of course you’re doing sexy films,” she noted during the online press conference for the movie last Wednesday, April 25. “Kumbaga, mahirap siya. Gusto ko kasing maging isang magaling na aktres. Kumbaga, pinasok ko ito, ano ba ang proseso para doon.”\\n(It is hard. I want to be a good actress. It is like, I went into this, so what is the process to become [a good actress]?)\\nTee felt she needed to get out of the box to make her dream come true.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n“Kailangan kong baliin ‘yung pagiging beauty queen na nakakahon lang ako sa roles na kailangan maganda, kailangan best friend ka ni ganito. I would forever get those roles if hindi ko babaliin ‘yung ganoon and hindi ko ipapakita na kaya kong maging isang magaling na aktres,” she said.\\n(I need to break [my image] of being a beauty queen where I am just boxed in roles where I need to be beautiful, to be just the best friend [of another character]. I would forever get those roles if I don’t break [that image] and show that I can be a good actress.)\\nImage: Instagram/@_janelletee\\n“If being sexy would be the starting process towards that, then I am embracing it fully now,” she added.\\nAs Euka, a bisexual in the movie, Tee discovered the world of a woman engaged in a girl-to-girl relationship.\\n“Wala sa gender ang pagmamahal. Kapag nagmahal ka ay ibinubuhos mo ang lahat at binibigyan mo ng buong-buo. Ito ang na-discover ko sa pagganap ko kay Euka. Kumbaga, lahat ibibigay mo at lahat hahamakin mo para sa pagmamahal,” she explained.\\n(Gender is not the basis of love. When you love someone, you give your all and you give fully. This is what I discovered from playing Euka. You will give everything and you can face anything in the name of love.)\\n“Putahe”, directed by Roman Perez, Jr. and which also stars Hershey de Leon, Massimo Scofield, Nathan Cajucom and Chad Solano, starts streaming May 13 on Vivamax.

       "  'full_article': '\\n\\nTessa Prieto-Valdes\\n“Not all storms come to disrupt your life, some come to clear your path.” —Paulo Coelho\\nI’m a firm believer that hope springs eternal. Springtime means rebirth. It’s the first of May, and it feels like an excellent time to restart that life plan that was put on hold because of the pandemic and all the turmoil it brought. This new journey of a thousand miles has to begin with a meaningful intention to jump-start the voyage. We may be still struggling, but there is light at the end of this dark tunnel.\\nCristalle Belo-Pitt, Millet Liberato Simeon at Red Charity Gala 2017\\nWe have weathered the storm somehow, all of us out in the rough seas, but not necessarily in the same boat. Some may have gone through the pandemic storm on a cruise liner, taking a leisurely break from the stresses of life, while others were braving the waves in a canoe.\\nDespite our different experiences, we are all hoping to get through this pandemic in our best capacity, with the aid of our family support group and our personal faith.\\nTaeho Lee, Korea Friends of Hope International country manager; Josefino B. Bonilla, Bahay Aruga board director; Viana Joan B. Mata, Bahay Aruga corporate secretary; Sungjae Kim, LG Electronics Philippines managing director; Kerry and Kaye Tiñga; Young Park, LG Electronics Philippines product director for Air Solutions\\nAfter a year of seeking my higher purpose following a drastic life shift, I have turned to the Lord through meditation, bible study and Catholic Mass.\\nWhen a catastrophic event happens in your life, whether it is physical, relational, or mental, there is a life-altering change in our mindset. Personally, I have radically refocused my priorities and time to the ones I love. Spending a month on a family vacation here in Australia has further cemented my life purpose and love of God and family.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDorothy and Raffy Toda, Alex Prieto, Mily Toda, Marixi Prieto, Sea Princess\\nP500,000 donation grant\\nTogether with Kaye Tiñga, my Red Charity Gala (RCG) partner, I am resuming plans of the next RCG event so that we may continue our charitable work. Thanks to our generous friends at LG Electronics Philippines, Kaye and I are able to continue helping the community in Siargao with their P500,000 donation grant.\\nOver the past few months, LG has been collecting entries for the first-ever local iteration of the LG Ambassador Challenge. The initiative, which was started with Korea Friends of Hope International (KFHI), is a first in the Philippines and affirms LG’s commitment to help deliver sustainable growth to local communities in the country.\\nJordan Prieto Valdes, Ikit Agudo, Gigi Forcadilla, Cheska Yupangco, Dodong Pacañor\\nAfter reviewing all the entries, LG selected Ride for Hope by Bahay Aruga and Roof for Siargao by RCG. Big thanks to good friend Millet Liberato Simeon for assisting us with this grant.\\nBahay Aruga, which was founded in 2014, is a free halfway house for pediatric cancer patients of Philippine General Hospital (PGH). Most of the children need to be in PGH weekly for long-term treatment in Manila. Hence, the halfway house was born.\\nEllen Lacson, Mila Lacson, Pinky Lacson-Villafuerte, Ed Lacson\\nAs endorsed by the oncology department of PGH, patients with their parents are fully accommodated at Bahay Aruga for free. Recently, the matriarch of Bahay Aruga who conceptualized the halfway house, Marietta Bonilla, passed away due to COVID-19. To continue the program, the Ride for Hope project aims to procure a new ambulance for the patients. Receiving the grant is Josefino B. Bonilla of the board of directors of Bahay Aruga.\\n“The daily battle of patients and carers is endless, but choosing Ride for Hope project, and with the new ambulance that we will be able to use, life will be more convenient and better for the pediatric cancer patients. Thank you, LG and KFHI for this program,” he says.\\nMillet Liberato Simeon, Athena Valdes, Bela Albert, Mica Ongsiako at Red Charity Gala 2017\\nInspire young people\\nSince 2009, RCG has been raising funds for numerous beneficiaries through the celebration of Philippine fashion. Collecting over P30 million in the last 11 years, RCG has distributed to Philippine Red Cross and Assumption HS ’81 Foundation, among others. These funds have been used for relief efforts and community building in provinces across the country. With the onset of the pandemic in 2020, our mission was put on hold.\\nMarilu Batchelor, Sofia Elizalde, Junie Peña, Samantha Hiranand, Sharm Hiranand, Techie Hagedorn\\nMy daughter, Jordan Prieto Valdes, has been very much present in the RCG events and witnessed everyone’s selfless generosity through the years. She had been living in Siargao for six months when Typhoon “Odette” (international name: Rai) hit the province in December.\\nAfter seeing the destruction that was made to her second home and to the lives of her friends, she was emboldened to start her own charity fundraising efforts online. It became apparent that her kindheartedness, generosity and her exposure to RCG, made her equipped to care for those whose lives were in shambles after the typhoon.\\nNikola, Sharon, Pinky, Jay, Ellen, Mila and Ed Lacson\\nEven after exhausting resources from family and friends from Manila and all over the world, Jordan still wanted to help Siargao. So, the RCG Roof for Siargao project was born. As RCG evolves, we go back to the core of bringing people together: It is about giving hope, sharing our blessings and empowering people to rebuild their lives.\\nSince I am here in Australia, Kaye and her daughter Kerry attended the awarding. Kaye shared her gratitude to LG saying, “The opportunity for Jordan Valdes to be chosen as an LG ambassador can inspire young people to take the initiative to help improve other people’s lives. We thank LG for giving us, Red Charity Gala, a unique opportunity to make a difference.”\\nMarilu Batchelor, Sofia Elizalde, Techie Hagedorn\\nWe continue to celebrate life and all the milestones from baptisms to birthdays to weddings, to even just waking up to another beautiful new day. There is always a joyous occasion to be tremendously grateful for. Just as LG says, “Life’s Good!”\\nFollow @seaprincess888 on Instagram.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'The precious gift of sports',\n",
       "  'full_article': '\\n\\nSpending our weekends (prepandemic) playing football/soccer for our school\\nBlood, sweat and tears. Are those the only things you gain once you enter the realm of sports? That’s a thought that gets people apprehensive once they step foot into it. For me, the biggest gift sports offer to us is something intangible, yet so invaluable.\\nFor obvious reasons, sports teach us how to strive to be the best. Whatever path you choose to walk on, someway, we are knowledgeable about how cutthroat the world is. For an idealist, this might not seem so hopeful, but to some extent it is. It means that we have this sense of individuality that we can exploit and expose to the world. I was a football varsity member during high school and whenever our coaches strategized prior to a game, we’d often hear caveats about how the opposing team usually plays. They stress upon what makes the team strong, and how we can attack and use their weakness to our advantage, and after the game, we think of how to become better.\\nAlong with that, we had to learn how to balance our academics, and other commitments, as most of my teammates were also leaders. Time management was a skill that I really acquired through sports. I remember someone giving me advice, in which she said, no matter how many commitments you have, we all have 24 hours in a day, it’s up to you how to triage these said commitments. Sometimes, other commitments deserve more attention, such as when we have important tournaments like the Women’s National Collegiate Athletic Association, or if finals season was coming up, studying hard would be a nonnegotiable. Moreover, sports are the ultimate package for those who have an insatiable hunger for self-improvement and self-awareness.\\nNo shortcuts\\nThree summers ago, I wanted to try boxing for no apparent reason, and I greatly relished it. But, the next day, I couldn’t move and my body felt like it weighed a ton as I dragged myself to wherever I had to go to. It got me thinking that our bodies are sort of like engines, we can’t just click the on button and accelerate. We have to warm it up and constantly use it in order for it not to break down because progress is not a linear graph with no setbacks, it’s more like a staircase.\\nFor the most part, the memories that remain vivid in my mind are those of the laughs and fond moments that I cherish up until now. After a long day of requirements, a game at the end of training feels like a breath of fresh air.\\nKick Off Philippines (@kickoffphofficial on Instagram) organizes flag football trainings, games and tournaments.\\nIn a new sport I play now, which is flag football, the community is so diverse, yet so inclusive. Playing sports with people who are always willing to teach you and learn from others is so reassuring, because everyone plays coach and teammate simultaneously. Many may say that sports can be, by no stretch of the imagination, a stress reliever because it induces more stress, most especially physically. But, the only thing sports falls short of is instant gratification, as you need to work hard in every aspect; there are no shortcuts, therefore I think that’s why happiness due to sports lasts longer, and is in all honesty, more gratifying than ever. Doesn’t that sound familiar? Isn’t that just like life in general? We work hard to be able to get the results we want, yet sometimes, we don’t get the results we’ve been praying for. But, just like in sports, it’s OK to cry about it, but what it shouldn’t do to us, is defeat our fighting spirits that can always bounce back.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhether you play sports on your weekends, or you dream of going professional, keep doing it. You’re doing yourself a favor by growing in environments that are so enriching when it comes to wisdom and self-exploration. Before joining varsity, I was in a slump and I found no motivation in anything at all, but after a spontaneous decision of trying out for a sport, I discovered all these parts of myself I never would’ve if it weren’t for sports. You begin to feel more confident in your own skin by just being yourself, but always constantly improving.\\nLooking back at a folder in my hard drive containing all pictures of me playing sports, whatever they may be, I noticed how varied my expressions were. My eyebrows meeting each other as I focused on the game I was playing, or my smile meeting my ears because I loved every aspect of it—the sport, the sun, the field, the free food, the satisfaction and blessing of being able to drink water after playing, the wins, the losses, my teammates and the person sports molded me into. So that’s the priceless gift of sports, it allows us to learn all sorts. —CONTRIBUTED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'A Gen Z kid’s thoughts on the elections',\n",
       "  'full_article': '\\n\\nFor the past few months, the many candidates vying for the different positions in the government have been trying their very best to sway potential voters in their favor. And for a lot of them, their advertisements and promotional materials have been focused on the youth—the first-time voters in Generation Z from the age of 18 to 24.\\nThough a nonvoter due to my birth date being a few months after the guidelines set by the Commission on Elections, I am happy to see that all of the candidates hoping for a seat in office recognize the importance of this generation, and the potential that we have for the future of the country in the many different fields that we like to specialize in. More opportunities from government organizations and companies have popped up in the past decade for young people to express themselves and, for the most part, it has been quite positive, something that should be credited to the current crop of politicians.\\nNevertheless, I cannot help but look into what we want in our politicians.\\nA politician’s role\\nCertainly, a politician’s role in our society is extremely important to the well-being of us all. The amending of laws and current policies that are inefficient and outdated allows for a better functioning government as a whole. Moreover, the passage of new laws that align to our ever-changing world allows for the country and its citizens to not fall behind to the rest of the world, keeping us at par with some of the more technologically advanced and capable nations around the globe.\\nDespite this, I at times find it very difficult to understand why we need to wait for the so-called next administration, next Congress, or just the next group of politicians to hold power, before we as a community start the change that we so ever desire. Shouldn’t we all do something right now that impacts our community, instead of toggling through our social media for hours? Can’t we all try to improve ourselves, some way, somehow so that we could be of valuable service to other people in the near future?\\nYes, I 100-percent support and agree that voicing out your concerns is important, and is integral to a well-oiled democracy. With so much misinformation and disinformation littering the internet, it is important that information going in is properly filtered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, at times, it just feels that we as the youngest generation have been very hypocritical with the current state of woke culture threatening the definition of true change for the community, leading to more intimidation and hate being spread online. As a result of the current structure of how social media functions nowadays, it promotes constant bickering and fighting between the people who have totally opposing views, causing online feuds and insults to be thrown at one another.\\nThe desire to be correct\\nFor instance, our desire to be correct causes a “crab mentality” where where we feel it necessary to stomp over other people. As media companies out there have put the majority of their resources on the campaign trail of the aspiring candidates, it has caused people to be overly loyal to the candidate of their choosing. This totally omits from the picture those who desperately need the news features and front page stories—the less fortunate who have been affected by alcoholism, abuse, natural disasters and mental health issues, to name a few.\\nWhat is perplexing is the fact that despite the country seeing a reported increase in depression and anxiety, as well as numerous natural disasters that have displaced many during the COVID-19 pandemic, many media stations still would rather flood their pages to report on the drama that surrounds the political landscape. Yes, politics is important, but with so many Filipinos who are unemployed and limping through the past two years of the health crisis, is it really necessary to report about those never-ending fights? Why not focus more on the farmers, the doctors, the students, the micro, small and medium enterprises, and so many more who have been negatively affected?\\nEspecially at the moment with this campaign period, it is confusing to see the news articles on political endorsements and the money involved in the process, when there are other key issues that should be prioritized over this political polarization. Creating division in the campaigning season will only bring about more challenges to the succeeding administration.\\nIn addition, with a lot of these politicians getting huge sums of money from us to push their political agenda and enrich the countless different media outlets nationwide, it is not surprising to see how many of those that actually need the money are not receiving it. With the huge sums of money pumped into these political campaigns that create hate and division in society, I wonder why this money can’t be given to those that are affected by the Marawi crisis, or those that are affected by the natural disasters, or given to nonprofit and nongovernment organizations that help those who are suffering from depression, heart diseases, cancer, violence and so much more.\\nYes, the government has a significant slice in the blame pie for the problems that this country faces. However, we also deserve a part of the slice as well for some of the issues in the Philippines.\\nThe overreliance that we have on one person and one government to somehow be able to change the country in a six-year term in office is bogus and unfair to them. Despite being given the position by the electorate, recognizing that the country will not be able to progress without our on-the-ground action is important as well in becoming a better Philippines. —CONTRIBUTED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n',\n",

No identification with actual persons (living or deceased), places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred. The article does not purport to reflect the opinions or views of Lifestyle Inquirer and Inquirer.net\\nOh yes, I support the LGBTs! I love LGBT people and I think they’re wonderful. I think they contribute a lot of amazing things to society and they are very talented. We shouldn’t underestimate them. We have to respect them. Some of them work for me and I’ve seen how hardworking and funny they are. I have LGBT friends and they are great.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLGBT people should be free to live the life that they want! They are born that way. What they do with their lives is not my business. They should be allowed to exist in society. As the Pope said, who am I to judge? Everyone should be happy. We should not judge people, especially LGBT people. We should all be equal. Equality is important.\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou know, I think I’m LGBT too. I feel the suffering of the community because I don’t like gender stereotyping. I don’t like being boxed into gender roles. Sometimes I even wear clothes that aren’t stereotypically meant for my gender. And I like to style my hair differently. Minsan undercut, sometimes long hair. People get confused about that! They don’t know if they should call me sir or ma’am. They’re also scared because I’ve beaten up people before, haha.\\nDo I support LGBT rights? What do you mean? Ah, you mean the SOGIE anti-discrimination law? Ano ba yang SOGIE-SOGIE na yan? Oh eto, yung anak ko, he’s so handsome. Para sa mga LGBTs, libre booking. Joke!\\nYou know kasi, I don’t think LGBT people are being discriminated against. There are isolated incidents. But generally, the Philippines is a very accepting country and we don’t need a law. Because that’s special protection! What about religion? We need to protect religion and beliefs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat was that again? You’re asking why am I fighting to protect my religious beliefs which I chose, but not the rights of LGBT people who didn’t choose because they were born that way? Who said they were born that way? I did? No, I think you didn’t hear me correctly. It’s on the record? No, you misunderstood me. LGBT people chose to live their lifestyle and it’s unfair to the majority that we give them special privileges.\\xa0\\nAnd honestly, as a Christian, I believe they are committing a sin. But I’m not saying I’m perfect! I’m just saying that we’re all sinful and we should follow God. God made man and woman, and women are meant for men. That’s why I don’t believe in same-sex marriage. I think it’s wrong and unnatural.\\xa0\\nWhat did you say? Homosexuality exists in 1,500 species of animals? I don’t believe that. I only trust the word of God. These scientific studies are no match for the Bible, because man’s knowledge is foolishness in God’s sight, 1 Corinthians 3:19.\\nBut let’s get back to what I was saying earlier because I think that it is the most important part you need to write as the headline: I love and support the LGBTs.\\nDidn’t you hear what I said? Why are you asking me what I’ve done for the community before? I think you’re purposely distracting people from my main message, which is that I love the LGBTs and I empathize with their problems.\\xa0\\nPlease stop bringing up the argument that the reason why LGBT people suffer is because of poverty, and that poverty is connected with what my family did, which is steal money from the government.\\xa0\\nYou don’t understand politics and statecraft, hija. You know sometimes we have to compromise to achieve the greater good. All you people do is complain, complain, complain. You don’t recognize all the things that you’ve gotten. You’re so ungrateful.

       "  'title': 'Terno design tilt turns spotlight on ‘Balintawak’',\n",
       "  'full_article': '\\n\\nCirca 1930s Balintawak from the album of Inang Paras. Traditionally the “alampay” matches the “tapis.”\\nThe second Ternocon held in January 2020 was one of the last big events held before the world went into lockdown. It had only been a few days since Taal Volcano in Batangas spewed plumes of ash that reached as far as Manila, and news of a deadly virus was already stoking fears.\\nThat glittering evening, however, guests in terno and barong Tagalog swanned around the lobby of the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) before being ushered into the main theater for the show where the terno was the star. Before the collections of the contestants were shown, mentors Lesley Mobo, Ivar Aseron and Philip Rodriguez first presented their own creations. The gold medal winner was Hannah Adrias, whose military-inspired collection caught the eye of the judges.\\nBalintawak with an image of the Philippine flag on the butterfly sleeves —FROM THE Collection of Gino Gonzales\\nFor the third Ternocon set for January 2023, the organizers, namely CCP through its Cultural Exchange Department (CED) and Bench/Suyen Corp, have decided to tone it down to reflect the times. Artistic director Gino Gonzales said it would be held in the afternoon for a more relaxed affair.\\nLast week, Gonzales, with designer Mobo, writer and historian Felice Sta. Maria and social historian Isidra Reyes gave online lectures to all the applicants on the topics “The Balintawak: Evolution, Context and Components,” “A Designer’s Creative Process,” “Filipinas who Wear the Terno” and “Wearing One’s Heart on One’s Sleeve.”\\nThis year, there were close to 80 applicants compared to the two previous Terncon competitions, with only around 50 applicants both times.\\n“We also received a lot of online inquiries, but we are going to be as stringent as we can before we decide on the final 12 contestants,” Gonzales told Lifestyle in a phone interview.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHand-tinted postcards of 1930s Balintawak from the album of Josefina T. Gonzales, a second-generation designer from the house of R.T. Paras. They show the various components of the ensemble and how they can be worn.\\nIn the past, the mentors led by veteran designer Into Sotto went through all the applicants’ designs and earlier works to check on their capabilities.\\n“For them to even be considered, they should already have certain skill sets in design, cutting and pattern making. They can’t be ordering a seamstress or a cutter to do their work for them,” Gonzales said.\\nAlso important is that finalists should be able to work with and take direction from their mentors. Gonzales said that in the past, there had been a few who refused to heed their mentors or were difficult to work with.\\n“They should realize how much work and time we all put in for this project, so we expect 100 percent participation from them.”\\nHand-tinted postcards of 1930s Balintawak from the album of Josefina T. Gonzales, a second-generation designer from the house of R.T. Paras. They show the various components of the ensemble and how they can be worn.\\nFour points\\nThis year, finalists will be tasked to create their version of the balintawak, which Gonzales described as “a more comfortable, country version of a terno.” The butterfly sleeves will still be present but unlike the more formal terno, the balintawak is distinguishable by four points.\\n“It is worn with an alampay, not a panuelo; paired with a tapis, not a sobrefalda; puts an emphasis on informality with the chosen fabric, print and cut; and is more about the countryside than the city. It will be now up to them how they interpret these guidelines,” he said.\\nHand-tinted postcards of 1930s Balintawak from the album of Josefina T. Gonzales, a second-generation designer from the house of R.T. Paras. They show the various components of the ensemble and how they can be worn.\\n“Another thing that’s different now is that they’re only required to make one outfit, unlike before when they were expected to make three terno using the P15,000 grant. It’s also the organizers’ way of helping them after two years of pandemic,” he added.\\nThis year’s mentors are designers Joey Samson, Dennis Lustico and Chito Vijandre, led by Inno Sotto.\\nGonzales has his hands full. Aside from his work as artistic director of Ternocon, he is also in charge of putting together an exhibit on indigenous clothing at the Ayala Museum, and is overseeing the refurbishing of Casa Gorordo, the museum in Cebu City housed in an old bahay na bato.\\nHand-tinted postcards of 1930s Balintawak from the album of Josefina T.

They show the various components of the ensemble and how they can be worn.\\n“We’re counting on the youth to push the terno forward, but we’re also thrilled to work with senior applicants. It’s heartening to see them working alongside their younger counterparts, to see their humility.”\\nThe competition is open to practicing Filipino designers or fashion design students who are at least 20 years old. The 12 finalists are expected to create one balintawak each.\\nThe finalists will be known by June 12 and will undergo RT-PCR testing before a week-long, locked-in workshop and mentoring in July and October. The final competition and cultural show are slated for Jan. 28, 2023.\\nFor more information, visit the CCP website, FB pages of Ternocon, CCP Cultural Exchange Department and Bench or email [email\\xa0protected].\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'full_article': '\\n\\nWhen Olivia Wilde was handed a mysterious envelope on stage midway through her presentation before a packed Las Vegas audience, many assumed it was the set-up for an elaborate joke.\\nInstead, she was getting served legal papers from her ex-partner Jason Sudeikis.\\n“This is for me, right?” asked Wilde, interrupted while introducing footage from her upcoming thriller “Don’t Worry Darling” during Warner Bros’ presentation\\xa0at CinemaCon, the annual movie theater industry gathering.\\n“Very mysterious. I’m going to open it now,” she said, opening an envelope marked “Personal and Confidential” after it was slid calmly onto the stage by an unknown person.\\nGlancing at its contents, she asked “Is this a script? OK, got it. Thank you,” before returning to her description of her upcoming thriller, hardly missing a beat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe envelope was never referred to again during the presentation, prompting speculation that somebody had tried to slip a new screenplay to the actor-director.\\nBut it emerged Wednesday the document held legal papers concerning two children Wilde has with her former partner Sudeikis, star of television comedy “Ted Lasso.”\\n“Papers were drawn up to establish jurisdiction relating to the children of Ms. Wilde and Mr. Sudeikis,” a source close to Sudeikis told AFP Wednesday.\\n“Mr. Sudeikis had no prior knowledge of the time or place that the envelope would have been delivered as this would solely be up to the process service company involved and he would never condone her being served in such an inappropriate manner.”\\nWilde’s representatives did not respond to a request for comment.\\n“Don’t Worry Darling,” a twisty, erotic thriller inspired by “The Truman Show” and “Inception,” stars Harry Styles, who is currently dating Wilde.\\n\\n\\nGet the latest lifestyle news delivered to your inbox\\n\\n\\n\\nBy providing an email address.
